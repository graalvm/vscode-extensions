Let's get started!

<!-- 2. Extension and GraalVM installations  -->

## Extension Installation

<!-- insert image tbd  -->

To install the GraalVM Tools for Java extension in VS Code:

1. Navigate to Extensions in the left-hand side Activity Bar (or use the _Ctrl+Shift+X_ hot keys combination).
2. Search for "GraalVM" in the search field.
3. Once found, press Install.
4. Reload when required.


## GraalVM Installation Wizard

After installing the extension, you can install GraalVM by using the built-in installation wizard (click the "Gr" icon in the left side Activity Bar).

You can either add existing GraalVM (if you have GraalVM already), or download it immediately from within VS Code. The "Download & Install GraalVM" action is preferable, as it eliminates the fuss around setting up environment variables and prepares the GraalVM runtime in VS Code for you.

Choose either the Community (free for all purposes) or Enterprise distribution (free for evaluation and development). You can also choose from the optional components (JavaScript & Node.js support, LLVM, etc.). <!-- what are these?  -->

For more information about GraalVM installation and setup, check the [extension documentation](README.md#graalvm-installation).

<!-- 3. Get started with Java development and debugging -->

## Java Development and Debugging
<!-- consider adding an image of JAVA -->
The GraalVM Tools for Java extension brings complete support for Java language development and debugging in VS Code, including popular features like auto completion, code navigation, and refactoring, etc.

Any application that runs on a JVM can run on GraalVM unmodified.
GraalVM includes a JDK based on the Java HotSpot VM, and integrates an optimizing, just-in-time (JIT) compiler, written in Java: the [Graal compiler](../../../reference-manual/java/compiler.md).

There are several launch configurations available by default, or you can add more.
Check the [extension documentation](README.md#java-development-and-debugging) to learn more.

<!-- 4.  VisualVM Integration -->

## Integration with VisualVM

GraalVM Tools for Java extension provides integration with [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io), which is the all-in-one Java (and polyglot) monitoring and troubleshooting tool.
This brings powerful yet easy-to-use visual Java tooling to VS Code.

A special launch configuration - **Launch VisualVM & Java 8+ Application** - is provided by the GraalVM Tools for Java extension to start VisualVM along with the project.

Check the [dedicated guide](visualvm-integration.md) about VisualVM and VS Code integration using the extension.

## Support for the Micronaut Framework
<!-- I only put this here because we have it as a bulletpoint, above... maybe either provide a few sentences here about it, or remove that bulletpoint? I took the below from the GVM Micronaut extension page... as I recall, it has something to do with launching apps? or no? if so, I think it's worth mentioning-->
In combination with the GraalVM Tools for Micronaut extension, you can run Micronaut projects on GraalVM and debug them directly from VS Code with different debugging protocols.


<!-- 5.  Ahead-of-time compilation with GraalVM Native Image -->


## Native Image

<!-- The GraalVM download includes GraalVM Native Image, which allows you to ahead-of-time compile your Java code to a standalone executable - directly in VS Code. Only the code that is required by the application at run time will be compiled and linked into the final native executable. The advantages are many, especially for microservices. -->

With GraalVM Tools for Java extension you can turn your Java projects into native executables directly in VS Code.
Your apps will:
* Be compiled into small footprints, on cloud, using a fraction of customary resources - so they run lightning fast.
* Achieve super fast startup, achieving peak performance with no warmup time
* Enjoy improved security by greatly reducing attack surfaces and thwarting reverse engineering

Learn more about the benefits of Native Image [here](../../../reference-manual/native-image/README.md).

### Tracing Agent <!-- MAYBE this tracing agent part can be omitted in this intro page? -->
GraalVM Tools for Java extension also provides experimental support for the Java [Tracing agent](../../../reference-manual/native-image/Agent.md) to automate the process of tracking and registering dynamic feature calls, making it even easier to build native images in VS Code.

A special launch configuration - **Launch Native Image Agent & Java 8+ Application** - is provided by the GraalVM Tools for Java extension to start a Java project with the Tracing agent.

Check the extension documentation to learn [how to build a native image and apply the Tracing agent from within VS Code](README.md#build-a-native-image).

### Native Image Debugging

The GraalVM Tools for Java extension provides Java-like debugging of native images directly from within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can set breakpoints, create watches, inspect the state of your application, even attach the debugger to a native image process in VS Code and step over the application source code!

Read more about this and find a demo application in the [Native Image Debugging guide](../../../reference-manual/native-image/Debugging.md).

<!-- 6. Popular Languages Support or GraalVM Languages Support or Features -->

## Polyglot Languages Support

<!-- Besides enabling a complete development environment for Java, GraalVM Tools for Java extension also provides full support for a number of popular languages such as
JavaScript, Ruby, R, Python. -->

The GraalVM Tools for Java extension enables a polyglot environment in VS Code, providing necessary editing and debugging features for a number of popular languages such as Python, Ruby, R, JavaScript, and Node.JS.
The extension allows for polyglot programming in a bidirectional way: you can embed JavaScript, Ruby, R, and Python in Java, or call Java from those languages.
<!-- maybe insert image of these languages' logos -->
<!-- A host JVM-based language and a guest language can directly interoperate with each other and pass data back and forth in the same memory space.
 -->
 Check the dedicated guide how to run and debug JavaScript and Node.js, Python, Ruby, and R applications with GraalVM Tools for Java extension in VS Code:
* [JavaScript and Node.js](polyglot-runtime.md#javascript-and-nodejs-support)
* [Python](polyglot-runtime.md#python-support)
* [Ruby](polyglot-runtime.md#ruby-support)
* [R](polyglot-runtime.md#r-support)

Thanks to GraalVM's [built-in implementation of the Language Server Protocol](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/tools/lsp/), smart editing features are provided for the guest languages like code-completion, find usages, go to declaration, and documentation on hover, etc.

It includes full debugging capabilities for those languages.
<!-- 7.  Popular Languages Debugging and Debug Adapter Protocol -->

## Polyglot Languages Debugging

Thanks to GraalVM's built-in implementation of the [Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/tools/dap/), a user can choose a debugging protocol in VS Code by setting to either `chromeDevTools` or `debugAdapter`.
<!-- The debug configurations differ per supported language.
 -->
The advantage of using the Debug Adapter Protocol over Chrome Dev Tools is that (1) it is "native" to VS Code, meaning it does not require any intermediate translatation, and (2) it supports multithreading, which can be particually useful to debug, e.g., a Ruby application.

Check the documentation for more information on [Polyglot Programming and Debugging in VS Code](polyglot-runtime.md).
