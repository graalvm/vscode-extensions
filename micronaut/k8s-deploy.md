# Deploy Micronaut Applications to Kubernetes

GraalVM Tools for Micronaut Extension added support for working with Kubernetes clusters based on Microsoftsâ€™s [Visual Studio Code Kubernetes Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools).
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating deployment and management of containerized applications.

It is now possible to create a Kubernetes deployment, deploy and debug a Micronaut project in a Kubernetes cluster on OCI - [Oracle-managed Container Engine for Kubernetes](https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/) environment.

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a Micronaut application to OKE from VS Code and debugging it.


You should dockerize your Micronaut project to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.
Once you have a Docker image of your project, follow these steps to deploy it to OKE:

### Preparation

To be able to deploy Docker images to (OCI) Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE), you need to set up the access.

You should dockerize your Micronaut project to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.
Once you have a Docker image of your project, deploy it to OKE.

## Deploy a Micronaut application to OKE

To create a a Kubernetes deployment and deploy a Micronaut application to OKE, the following quick actions for Micronaut are available:

1. Go to View > Command Palette, search for **Create Kubernetes Deployment Resource** action and invoke it:

2. You will be prompted to select which Docker image to be used:

3. Then select a secret for a container registry in OCI:

The `Deploy.yaml` will be created. It will look similar to the following:

3. Then you can deploy. Go to View > Command Palette, search for **Deploy to Kubernetes Cluster** action and invoke it.
You could have skipped steps 1-3, but if no Kubernetes deployment file exists, VS Code will suggest you to create one at this step.

## Attach to Remote Debugger from OKE

In addition to being able to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster and create Kubernetes deployments for Micronaut applications from VS, you can also attach to a remote Kubernetes cluster and debug your Java 8 and up application right from VS Code.
For that you need to ensure the [GraalVM Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graalvm) is also installed.
It is not needed if you have installed [GraalVM Tools for Java Extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graalvm-pack), it already includes a full-fledged support for the Java and Micronaut.

1. When deployed it is possible to debug this K8s node using Kubernetes Extension
2. Connect Kubernetes extension to your K8s cluster using Set Kubeconfig
3. Then select the node you are developing and invoke action Debug (Attach using Java 8+):

This will perform kubectl portforward and debugging remote K8s pod using kubectl port forwarding capabilities.

To get started, you need to get the latest stable GraalVM release using the Download & Install GraalVM action from the Gr activity view, as described in the Installation and Setup section. Make sure the GraalVM is set as the active.
Once a GraalVM installation is set as active, the Command Palette contains the following commands related to VisualVM:
