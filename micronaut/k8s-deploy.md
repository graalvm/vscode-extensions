# Deploy Micronaut Applications to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes

GraalVM Tools for Micronaut Extension added support for working with Kubernetes clusters based on Microsofts’s [Visual Studio Code Kubernetes Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools).

It is now possible to deploy and debug a Micronaut project to Kubernetes on Oracle Cloud with Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/) environment.
OKE is a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service that you can use to deploy your containerized applications to the cloud.

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a Micronaut application to OKE from VS Code and debugging it.

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio Code Kubernetes Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)
- [Oracle Cloud Account](https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/free/)
- [Access to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/oci-library/oci-hol/OKE/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=intro)

## Preparation

### Visual Studio Code Kubernetes Tools
Micronaut's extension support for Kubernetes is based on Microsofts’s [Visual Studio Code Kubernetes Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools). It has to be installed.

Open Extensions tab, search for "Kubernetes" and install the one from Microsoft.
Once installed, you should see the Kubernetes icon in the left sidebar:
![Kubernetes extension installed](images/kubernetes_icon.png)

### Oracle Cloud Account

If you have not got an active Oracle Cloud account, create one by following this [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/get-oracle-com-account.html).

### Access to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)

Supposedly, you have signed in to your Oracle Cloud account.
To be able to deploy Docker images to Oracle Container Registry, you need to setup the access to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE).

#### Step 1: Create a Kubernetes cluster in OCI

Using the Oracle Cloud Console, create a Kubernetes cluster with default settings using the *Quick Create* workflow:

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, open the navigation menu and click **Developer Services**.
2. Under Containers, click **Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)**.
3. Then click **Create Cluster**.

For more information, check this [guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengcreatingclusterusingoke_topic-Using_the_Console_to_create_a_Quick_Cluster_with_Default_Settings.htm).

#### Step 2: Set up access to Kubernetes cluster

You can access your Kubernetes cluster and manage it using `kubectl`.
The `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
To do that you have to set up a Kubernetes configuration file, _kubeconfig_.
The kubeconfig file (by default stored and can be found in the _$HOME/.kube/config_) provides the necessary details to access the cluster.

See the [Setting Up Local Access to Clusters](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengdownloadkubeconfigfile.htm#localdownload) guide for step-by-step instructions.

### Log in to Docker

To be able to dockerize your Micronaut project, push and pull images on a local machine, and deploy to Oracle Container Registry, you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).
To check whether [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) is started and running on your computer, go to VS Code Terminal and type: `docker --help`.

Next you need to login with Docker to your Oracle Container Registry.
Prepare following Oracle Cloud account credentials:

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancy name
- User email address used for your OCI account
- OCI authentification token
- OCI region key

From VS Code Terminal window, log in using the following command:
```bash
docker login -u <tenancy-namespace>/<oci-user-email> -p <auth token> <region-key>.ocir.io
```
For example, if your OCI region is US East (Ashburn), then the key will be `iad`, and the region endpoint will be `https://iad.ocir.io`.
The list of available regions and their keys is available [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Concepts/registryprerequisites.htm).

> NOTE: If the Docker registry is private you will need a Docker registry secret.

This [guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengpullingimagesfromocir.htm) describes how to create a Docker registry secret and describes how to specify the image to pull from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (along with the Docker secret to use) during application deployment to a cluster you've created using OKE.

### Specify the Location for Docker Image in Oracle Container Registry

The location where to push your Docker image in Oracle Container Registry should be specified in the project configuration file.

If you used Gradle to build your Micronaut project, open the _gradle.build_ file and update image location:
  ```xml
  dockerBuild {
  images = ["<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>"]
  }
  ```

See, for example, this example project configuration:
![Docker image location](images/docker_image_location.png)

<!-- If you used Maven to build your Micronaut project, open _pom.xml_, find the `dockerBuild` task and update the image location: -->

## Deploy a Micronaut Application to OKE

To deploy, run and debug a Micronaut application in Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE), the following quick actions for Micronaut are available:

![Kubernetes quick actions](images/k8s_quick_actions.png)

You should start by creating a Kubernetes deployment file that will be applied at the deployment stage.

1. Go to View > Command Palette, search for "Kubernetes" and invoke the **Micronaut: Create Kubernetes Deployment Resource** action. It will start the "Create Kubernetes Deployment File" process.

2. Pick the Docker repository. Since you are using Oracle Container Registry, select **OCIR + region name**. For example:
   ![Pick Docker repository](images/pick_docker_repository.png)

3. Provide your Docker image name and version:
   ![Provide Docker image name and version](images/provide_image_name_version.png)
   Currently, available images are not automatically detected, so you need to type it manually.
   Grab the image location from _gradle.build_ or _pom.xml_ you specified in the **Specify the Location for Docker Image in Oracle Container Registry** step.

4. Then you are prompted to select the namespace. Choose default:
   ![Select namespace](images/select_namespace.png)

5. Lastly, select a secret for your container registry in OCI (needed only if the Docker registry is private, described in the **Preparation** > **Log in to Docker** section):

    ![Select a secret for Docker registry](images/select_secret.png)

    The `Deploy.yaml` will be created. It will look similar to the following:

    ![Deploy.yaml](images/deploy_yaml.png)

Now you are ready to deploy your Micronaut application to OKE.

1. Go to View > Command Palette, search for **Micronaut: Deploy to Kubernetes Cluster** action and invoke it.
   You could have skipped steps 1-3 from above, but if no Kubernetes deployment file exists, VS Code will suggest you to create one at this step.

2. Once you invoke the action, the Output window will open and the "Starting deploy of project" message will be printed.

When you hit this action, the project is packaged with Gradle/Maven to a runnable JAR file, built into a Docker image.
Then Docker pushes this image to the OKE repository (Oracle Container Registry), by applying the _deploy.yaml_ script.
The Kubernetes extension starts port forwarding to connect to the server running in a Kubernetes cluster (`kubectl port-forward` forwards a local port to a port on the Pod).
A direct URL to access your Micronaut REST application from a browser is printed.
Read more on Kubernetes port forwarding [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/).


All this can be tracked in the Output window.
If the deployment succeeds, you should see a similar status bar:

![Kubernetes deploy status](images/k8s_deply_output.png)

To otherwise check the deployment's status, run:
```bash
kubectl get deployment
```

You can work on other projects, deploy them to another Kubernetes clusters, and they will all be deployed and running from Oracle Container Registry.

## Debug Micronaut Applications in Remote Kubernetes Cluster

In addition to being able to deploy and run Micronaut applications in Kubernetes, you can also debug your Java application in a cluster directly from VS.

> Note: [GraalVM Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graalvm) is required.

To allow complete Java debugging experience, you need to ensure the [GraalVM Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graalvm) is installed.
It is not needed if you have installed [GraalVM Tools for Java Extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graalvm-pack), it already includes a full-fledged support for the Java and Micronaut.

With the connection made to a local port (thanks to [Kubernetes port forwarding feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/)), you can use your local workstation to debug the application that is running in the Pod.
Having set some breakpoints in your applciation, do the following to start debugging:

To debug a Java application, creating a launch configuration for the application is necessary.
1. Go to View > Command Palette, search for **Micronaut: Debug in Kubernetes** action and invoke it.
2. First time you start debugging in Kubernetes, a popup window will open in the right bottom corner asking to confirm port forwarding. Confirm it. This will setup a `JAVA_TOOLS_OPTIONS` environment variable in the deployment script file.
3. Then you will be prompted to choose a port forwarding session:
   ![Choose a port forwarding session](images/k8s_port_forwarding)

4. Connect the Kubernetes extension to your Kubernetes cluster using **Set Kubeconfig** action.
5. Click on Kubernetes icon in the left sidebar and select the node you are developing.
6. Right-click invoke action Debug (**Attach using Java 8+**):
